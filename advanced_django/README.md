In this project-based course, software engineer Ryan Mitchell takes a deep dive into Django, the framework that is the back end of high-traffic websites like Instagram and Pinterest. Designed for advanced Django users, Ryan presents a social media website project as a framework for how to tackle any web engineering situation and translate it into Django code. She shows how to build custom validators, filters, and managers; how to extend and augment the default Django settings and models; and how to eliminate code redundancy and implement clean error handling, authentication, caching, and other tools. If youâ€™re looking for some hands-on work to learn how to apply Django to develop anything from a retail store to a personal portfolio to a company website and more, join Ryan in this course.
