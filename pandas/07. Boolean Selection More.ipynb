If we wanted to test whether there was more capacity at the start of the ride vs the end, we would do the following:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"id":"cAaK33qrfkBm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675349271889,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":404,"user":{"displayName":"Tania Mangolini","userId":"11639081150182463204"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["filt = bikes['start_capacity'] > bikes['end_capacity']"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ge1Y4KAGfkBn"},"source":["Let's use this filter with `loc` to return all the rows where the start capacity is greater than the end."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"id":"Kh38iMs9fkBo","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":143},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675349275072,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Tania Mangolini","userId":"11639081150182463204"}},"outputId":"8c54ebbe-1303-4cf7-f53b-2161affe9f34"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   start_capacity  end_capacity\n","1            31.0          19.0\n","6            31.0          19.0\n","8            31.0          15.0"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-c49c6398-aa24-4391-8e92-9a13d1da7c21\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>start_capacity</th>\n","      <th>end_capacity</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>31.0</td>\n","      <td>19.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>31.0</td>\n","      <td>19.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <td>31.0</td>\n","      <td>15.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-c49c6398-aa24-4391-8e92-9a13d1da7c21')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-c49c6398-aa24-4391-8e92-9a13d1da7c21 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
